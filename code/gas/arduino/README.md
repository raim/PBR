1) Download required libraries UTFT [1] and UTouch [2] 
and either unzip to your Arduino libraries folder
or import the .zip files

2) Generate symbolic links from the directories in 
this folder to your Arduino "sketchbook" or "Arduino" folder 
(which commonly also hosts the required libraries from point (1))

3) Open the "sketches" in the Arduino IDE and upload
to your Arduino Mega 2560
