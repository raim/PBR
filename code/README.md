# Code for A Modular PhotoBioreactor

Independent modules for control and measurement of gas, liquid,
light and heat flux through a bioreactor; additional modules
for automated sampling.

The modules should work as independent devices and are each 
controlled via an Arduino Mega+Touchscreen (Sainsmart SSD1289).

The goal is to combine them into diverse bioreactor setups with
a control software that synchronizes and collects data from each
module via defined get/set interfaces.

TODO: move common functions, e.g., for the Arduino Mega+Touchscreen,
into a separate Arduino library.
