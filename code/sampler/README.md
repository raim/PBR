# The Kaiten Eppi

An automated sampling system, controlled by 2 stepper motors:

* Stepper-motor controlled syringe pump, as in [this hackaday project](https://hackaday.io/project/1838-open-syringe-pump) with [code and 3D files at github](https://github.com/naroom/OpenSyringePump)
* A turning table with tube holders; TODO: open/close tubes, measure OD, freeze
eg. in liquid N2

# The Kaiten Syringe

The syringe sampler (as above) is moved over a 96-well plate (pre-filled 
manually or with a second Kaiten) and fills samples into wells; the plate
is positioned vertically over the plate holder of a plate-reader and
is inserted to the plate reader when the Kaiten Syringe is done.
