# KAITEN EPPI

An automated sampling system, controlled by 2 stepper motors:

* Stepper-motor controlled syringe pump, as in https://hackaday.io/project/1838-open-syringe-pump with code and 3D files at https://github.com/naroom/OpenSyringePump
* A turning table with tube holders; TODO: open/close tubes, measure OD, freeze
eg. in liquid N2
