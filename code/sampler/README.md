# The Kaiten Eppi

An automated sampling system, controlled by 2 stepper motors:

* Stepper-motor controlled syringe pump, as in [this hackaday project](https://hackaday.io/project/1838-open-syringe-pump) with [code and 3D files at github](https://github.com/naroom/OpenSyringePump)
* A turning table with tube holders; TODO: open/close tubes, measure OD, freeze
eg. in liquid N2
