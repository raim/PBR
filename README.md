# Open and Modular Photobioreactor for Quantiative and Theoretical Biology

Code repository for a modular photobioreactor, based on arduino
and raspberry pi controlled sensor and control devices. 

Initiated at the 1st QTB PBR Hack`a'thing, March 2-4 2016, at the
Quantitative and Theoretical Biology Group of the Heinrich-Heine
University DÃ¼sseldorf. See
[QTB wiki page](https://wiki.hhu.de/display/QTBP/1st+QTB+PBR+Hack%60a'thing).

Inspired by prior work from Dougie B. Murray and Rob Lehmann, fuelled by
the DIY spirit.
