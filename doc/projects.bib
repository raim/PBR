                   shake flask cultivations by monitoring three basic
                   parameters (pH, pO2 and biomass). The focus lies on
                   the evaluation of the biomass sensor based on
                   backward light scattering. The application spectrum
                   was expanded to four new organisms in addition to E.
                   coli K12 and S. cerevisiae [1]. It could be shown
                   that the sensor is appropriate for a wide range of
                   standard microorganisms, e.g., L. zeae, K. pastoris,
                   A. niger and CHO-K1. The biomass sensor signal could
                   successfully be correlated and calibrated with
                   well-known measurement methods like OD600, cell dry
                   weight (CDW) and cell concentration. Logarithmic and
                   Bleasdale-Nelder derived functions were adequate for
                   data fitting. Measurements at low cell concentrations
                   proved to be critical in terms of a high signal to
                   noise ratio, but the integration of a custom made
                   light shade in the shake flask improved these
                   measurements significantly. This sensor based
                   measurement method has a high potential to initiate a
                   new generation of online bioprocess monitoring.
                   Metabolic studies will particularly benefit from the
                   multisensory data acquisition. The sensor is already
                   used in labscale experiments for shake flask
                   cultivations.},

  abstract =      {BACKGROUND: Baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
                   as one of the most often used workhorses in
                   biotechnology has been developed into a huge family
                   of application optimised strains in the last decades.
                   Increasing numbers of strains render their
                   characterisation highly challenging, even with the
                   simple methods of growth-based analytics. Here we
                   present a new sensor system for the automated,
                   non-invasive and parallelisable monitoring of biomass
                   in continuously shaken shake flask cultures, called
                   CGQ ("cell growth quantifier"). The CGQ implements a
                   dynamic approach of backscattered light measurement,
                   allowing for efficient and accurate growth-based
                   strain characterisation, as exemplarily demonstrated
                   for the four most commonly used laboratory and
                   industrial yeast strains, BY4741, W303-1A, CEN.PK2-1C
                   and Ethanol Red. RESULTS: Growth experiments revealed
                   distinct carbon source utilisation differences
                   between the investigated S. cerevisiae strains.
                   Phenomena such as diauxic shifts, morphological
                   changes and oxygen limitations were clearly
                   observable in the growth curves. A strictly monotonic
                   non-linear correlation of OD600 and the CGQ's
                   backscattered light intensities was found, with
                   strain-to-strain as well as growth-phase related
                   differences. The CGQ measurements showed high
                   resolution, sensitivity and smoothness even below an
                   OD600 of 0.2 and were furthermore characterised by
                   low background noise and signal drift in combination
                   with high reproducibility. CONCLUSIONS: With the CGQ,
                   shake flask fermentations can be automatically
                   monitored regarding biomass and growth rates with
                   high resolution and parallelisation. This makes the
                   CGQ a valuable tool for growth-based strain
                   characterisation and development. The exceptionally
                   high resolution allows for the identification of
                   distinct metabolic differences and shifts as well as
                   for morphologic changes. Applications that will
                   benefit from that kind of automatized biomass
                   monitoring include, amongst many others, the
                   characterization of deregulated native or integrated
                   heterologous pathways, the fast detection of
                   co-fermentation as well as the realisation of
                   rational and growth-data driven evolutionary
                   engineering approaches.},

  abstract =      {Circadian rhythms are endogenously generated daily
                   oscillations in physiology that are found in all
                   kingdoms of life. Experimental studies have shown
                   that the fitness of Synechococcus elongatus, a
                   photosynthetic microorganism, is severely affected in
                   non-24-h environments. However, it has been difficult
                   to study the effects of clock-environment mismatch on
                   cellular physiology because such measurements require
                   a precise determination of both clock state and
                   growth rate in the same cell. Here, we designed a
                   microscopy platform that allows us to expose
                   cyanobacterial cells to pulses of light and dark
                   while quantitatively measuring their growth, division
                   rate, and circadian clock state over many days. Our
                   measurements reveal that decreased fitness can result
                   from a catastrophic growth arrest caused by
                   unexpected darkness in a small subset of cells with
                   incorrect clock times corresponding to the subjective
                   morning. We find that the clock generates rhythms in
                   the instantaneous growth rate of the cell, and that
                   the time of darkness vulnerability coincides with the
                   time of most rapid growth. Thus, the clock mediates a
                   fundamental trade-off between growth and starvation
                   tolerance in cycling environments. By measuring the
                   response of the circadian rhythm to dark pulses of
                   varying lengths, we constrain a mathematical model of
                   a population's fitness under arbitrary light/dark
                   schedules. This model predicts that the circadian
                   clock is only advantageous in highly regular cycling
                   environments with frequencies sufficiently close to
                   the natural frequency of the clock.},

                   laboratory, circadian clocks do not generally
                   free-run but are driven by daily cues whose timing
                   varies with the seasons. The principles that
                   determine how circadian clocks align to these
                   external cycles are not well understood. Here, we
                   report experimental platforms for driving the
                   cyanobacterial circadian clock both in vivo and in
                   vitro. We find that the phase of the circadian rhythm
                   follows a simple scaling law in light-dark cycles,
                   tracking midday across conditions with variable day
                   length. The core biochemical oscillator comprised of
                   the Kai proteins behaves similarly when driven by
                   metabolic pulses in vitro, indicating that such
                   dynamics are intrinsic to these proteins. We develop
